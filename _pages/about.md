I am a PhD candidate at the [University College London's Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/research/research-labs/multi-sensory-devices) and [Interaction Centre (UCLIC)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/uclic), supervised by [Marianna Obrist](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/78441-marianna-obrist), [Elia Gatti](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/93101-elia-gatti) and [Youngjun Cho](https://profiles.ucl.ac.uk/54637-youngjun-cho). Also, I serve as an [Athena Swan](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/about/equity-diversity-and-inclusion/gender-equality-athena-swa) (gender equality) PhD Student Rep at CS UCL.

My research interest lies in Human-Centred AI and AI for social good. I code 👩🏻‍💻, conduct studies on Human-AI interaction and love taking new projects! One of my PhD focuses is to bring human-awareness to machine-awareness within the [UKRI Textile Circularity project](https://textilescircularity.rca.ac.uk/) 🧶.
